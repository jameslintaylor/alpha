## Expected work

### Interaction design
interactions in the application will be designed in such a way as to strike an optimal balance between maximizing speed and minimizing unwanted invocations/errors.

### Asset design/creation
assets (icons, sound effects etc...) will be designed to in accordance with industry best practices and design language. Where appropriate.

### Application flow design
application flow will strive to be designed in such a way that the application can be navigated intuitively by as many users as possible.

### Natural language design
choosing keywords/hooks essential to the natural language portion of the application should be made keeping in mind as large of a set of end consumers as possible (these may include non english first language speakers etc.)

### Conversation design
conversations with our chat bot will be designed to be as 'human' as possible. We are not claiming artificial intelligence is a main goal of the project, but we will design the bot to mimic something of that nature.

### Proof of concept implementation
seeing as we are to be providing a proof of concept to demo at the end of this project, we will inevitably need to do some implementation of the design. This may, but is by no means set a frontend implementation, a backend implementation, and api design.
