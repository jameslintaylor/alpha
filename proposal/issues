There are issues in current processes that one has to undergo when responding to meeting invites and planning meetings with others. Tools such as Need To Meet and Google Calendar, though widely used, could be improved on.

Need To Meet, though simple to use on desktop, lacks a mobile friendly site. This causes friction in the interactions necessary to use the app and adds more work for the user; for example, the user now needs to zoom into the website and drag to navigate the input forms. 

Google Calendar and other systems like it (e.g. Microsoft Outlook) are not the most intuitive to use on desktop. The user creates an event and then edits the event information. When editing the event information there is a guest list where you can enter the email address of all the guests you would like to invite. It is assumed that adding an address to the list would send an invite to the corresponding guest, but nothing happens. Instead, you have to press “email” to the right of the guest list for the invitees to be notified of the event. Then, from the email sent to the user, no action can be done. The visual affordance of the main content of the email is a clickable element that would take me to Google Calendar to see more information — unfortunately hovering over the element does not cause the cursor to change to a pointer, and clicking causes no action.
