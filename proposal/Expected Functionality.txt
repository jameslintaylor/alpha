The final product is expected to be similar to fully functional, 
its design is to be a prototype of what the product could be. This 
will include having the chat bot mimic speech and response, as 
well as having the bot be able to respond to certain phrases or
verbs which can indicate whether a user may or may not be able to do a certain action (e.g. be available for meeting). The bot's responses will be integrated in such a way that its responses will seem similar to how a human would respond (within reason).
