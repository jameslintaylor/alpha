* Critique of Doodle Poll [[https://beta.doodle.com]]

  A scheduling system such as Doodle strives primarily to achieve one
  thing: Have a group of participants reach an agreement on a time and
  place to meet.

  As such, there are two primary tasks a user of the system will want
  to accomplish: Creating a new event and Responding to an event
  invitation. This critique will focus on those two tasks.

** Creating a new event

  From a new user's perspective, Doodle does a good job at keeping its
  design language (button style, icon choice etc.) in accordance with
  popular modern practice. The homepage [[https://beta.doodle.com]]
  lists only a few options with the most likely next step (Create a
  Doodle/Create Doodle poll) made clearly the most prevalent among
  them.

  A text entry field inhabited by the "What's the occasion"
  placeholder gives is given immediate focus upon loading the
  page. There may be some unhelpful redundancy between the two
  separate "Create Doodle poll" buttons made available. Both fulfill
  nearly the exact same functionality (the difference being that the
  button next to the form will populate the "Enter title" field on the
  event creation page with the contents of the "What's the occasion"
  text field.

  The first step on the event creation page is to outline some
  information about the occasion. Something lacking here is a clear
  way for a user to cancel the creation of the new event. Simply
  leaving the page or pressing the back button in the browser
  accomplishes this, but this may not be obvious to every user.
  
  The second step presents a dialog for selecting dates for the
  event. Although the creator can select as many days as they like in
  this dialog (these will be the options participants choose from),
  events are effectively limited to single days. Beyond selecting
  multiple adjacent (but still independent), there is no first class
  method for creating an event spanning two or more days.

  After an event has been created, it is given a unique URL that can
  be shared with event invitees. The creator can register to be
  notified of activity within their event and is given control over
  finalizing the date once she/he deems that a sufficient number of
  people have voted.

** Voting on/Responding to an event invitation

  Going to an event URL, an invitee is presented with the homepage for
  the event. The event homepage does very little in terms of guiding
  the user towards what they are meant to do. There is a somewhat
  inconspicuous text field with the greyed out placeholder "Enter your
  name" as well as boxes for the user to vote on the proposed
  dates. Doing something as little as giving the name field focus (as
  was done with the Doodle's index) would at least guide a new user in
  the right direction.
